	help
	  Image Tag is the firmware header used by broadcom on their xDSL line
	  of devices. It is used to describe the offsets and lengths of kernel
	  and rootfs partitions.
	  This driver adds support for parsing a partition with an Image Tag
	  header and creates up to two partitions, kernel and rootfs.

config MTD_PARSER_TRX

	depends on MTD && (BCM47XX || ARCH_BCM_5301X || COMPILE_TEST)
	help
	  TRX is a firmware format used by Broadcom on their devices. It
	  may contain up to 3/4 partitions (depending on the version).
	  This driver will parse TRX header and report at least two partitions:
	  kernel and rootfs.

config MTD_SHARPSL_PARTS

	help
	  This provides the read-only FTL logic necessary to read the partition
	  table from the NAND flash of Sharp SL Series (Zaurus) and the MTD
	  partition parser using this code.
