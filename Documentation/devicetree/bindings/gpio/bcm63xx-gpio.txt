* Broadcom BCM63XX GPIO controller

Required properties:
- compatible: "brcm,bcm63xx-gpio"
  Compatible with all BCM63XX SoCs.

- reg: address and length of the register block.

- gpio-controller: This is a GPIO controller.

- #gpio-cells: Must be <1>. The cell is the GPIO pin.

- brcm,num-gpios: number of GPIOs present in this SoC.

Example:

	gpio: gpio@80 {
		compatible = "brcm,bcm63xx-gpio";
		reg = <0x80 0x80>;
		gpio-controller;
		#gpio-cells = <1>;
		brcm,num-gpios = <40>;
	};
